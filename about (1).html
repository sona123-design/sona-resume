<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello everyone, warm greetings. This side Sona. I am a web developer. I have recently started the web development journey
and i got that so interesting and engaging work and also quite simpler than complex coding languages. I am currently a second year 
day scholar student in Indira Gandhi Delhi Technical For Women and pursuing Btech Computer Science and Engineering. This is my 
first ever portfolio in the field of Web development. Hope all the viewers must appreciate my efforts.
</p>

<p>This is an individual portfolio project inspired and trained by the udemy course instructor and techer named Angela.
  She is just doing an incredible work in providing the beginner students like us, such an outstading quality education and always 
  interactive with us and she is a very optimistic and motivating human. It is said that our interest in a particular subject builds
  due to a good ideal or guider and she is a best example for it.
</p>

<p>So, this is just my learning phase and I'm in the slight middle of this phase. More such projects with more specifications will come
  into picture in the future, so stay tuned. Until then stay happy, stay safe.  </p>
